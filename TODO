Test output with different families
Test output with bootstrap method mode approximation
Test with and without gradient computation
Add function to approximate Hessian
Add smoothing method
Test output with offsets and weights
Use kernal approximation method
Better `logLik` method implementation
Test method works when there are time points with no observations
