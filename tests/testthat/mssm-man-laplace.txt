Call:  mssm(fixed = formula(glm_fit), family = Gamma("log"), data = Gasoline, 
    random = ~1, ti = year, control = mssm_control(N_part = 1000L, 
        n_threads = 1L, ftol_abs = 1e-08, ftol_abs_inner = 1e-08))

Family is 'Gamma' with link 'log'.
Parameters are estimated with a Laplace approximation.
State vector is assumed to be X_t ~ N(F * X_(t-1), Q).

F estimate is
            (Intercept)
(Intercept)       0.979

Q's standard deviations estimates are
(Intercept) 
    0.00466 

Dispersion parameter estimate is 0.000291

Fixed coefficients estimates are
